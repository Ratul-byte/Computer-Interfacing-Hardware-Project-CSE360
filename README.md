# Advanced Safety Helmet with Nestled Security & Communication Protocols

## Overview

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This is a small project developed during our university's Computer Interfacing course. Here we designed **intelligent safety helmet** to enhance rider protection using modern sensors and communication technologies. It detects accidents, alcohol consumption, theft, and obstacles, and can send emergency alerts using Bluetooth communication. The helmet incorporates a combination of sensors, buzzers, LEDs, and buttons to provide real-time safety feedback. Arduino 2.3.6 was used to upload and compile the code for the Arduino Uno to run the project.

## Communication Protocols

- **I2C**: For MPU6050 sensor (SDA/SCL)
- **UART**: For Bluetooth communication (TX/RX)
- **Digital/Analog I/O**: For other sensors, buzzers, and LEDs

## Features

- **Crash Detection**: Triggered when pitch or roll exceeds 45Â°
- **Alcohol Detection**: Activates alerts if the alcohol level crosses a threshold
- **Helmet Detection**: Ensures the helmet is worn before operation
- **Theft Alert**: IR sensor triggers alert on unauthorized access
- **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic sensor detects objects within 20cm
- **SOS Alert**: Emergency messages are sent with a button press

## Challenges & Solutions

- **MQ3 Sensor Noise**: Mitigated by using a threshold of >300
- **False Crash Detection**: Limited to >45Â° tilt to reduce false alerts
- **Sensor Inconsistencies**: Delays and flags used to debounce inputs
- **Power Consumption**: Buzzer/LEDs turned on only when needed

## Future Enhancements

- Add **GPS module** for live tracking
- Add **SIM800L** for SMS-based emergency alerts (without Bluetooth)
- Include **camera module** for evidence collection
- Connect **alcohol sensor to ignition** to prevent drunk driving
- Potential use for delivery riders, law enforcement, and transport services

## Expected Outcomes

- Real-time alerts for crashes, alcohol detection, and theft
- Efficient, low-power consumption design
- Scalable and practical for commercial and personal use
