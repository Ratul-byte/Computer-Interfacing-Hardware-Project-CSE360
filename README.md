# Advanced Safety Helmet with Nestled Security & Communication Protocols

## Overview

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This is a small project developed during our university's **Computer Interfacing** course. Here we designed an **intelligent safety helmet** which enhances rider protection using modern sensors and communication technologies. It detects accidents, alcohol consumption, theft, and obstacles, and can send emergency alerts using Bluetooth communication. The helmet incorporates a combination of sensors, buzzers, LEDs, and buttons to provide real-time safety feedback. Arduino 2.3.6 was used to upload and compile the code for the Arduino Uno to run the project.

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE**: For programming and uploading code to the Arduino Uno.
### Libraries:
- **Wire.h** (for I2C communication with MPU6050)
- **SoftwareSerial.h** (for Bluetooth communication with HC-06)

## Communication Protocols

- **I2C**: For MPU6050 sensor (SDA/SCL)
- **UART**: For Bluetooth communication (TX/RX)
- **Digital/Analog I/O**: For other sensors, buzzers, and LEDs

## Setup Instructions

- Connect the MPU6050 to the Arduino Uno via I2C (SDA to A4, SCL to A5).
- Connect the MQ3 sensor to analog pin A0.
- Connect the IR sensor to digital pin 2.
- Connect the touch sensor to digital pin 6.
- Connect the ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) with Trig to pin 11 and Echo to pin 12.
- Connect LEDs to pins 7, 8, and 10.
- Connect buzzers to pins 9 and 13.
- Connect the SOS button to pin 4 and the kill switch to pin 5.
- Connect the HC-06 Bluetooth module to TX and RX pins for serial communication.

## Features

- **Crash Detection**: Triggered when pitch or roll exceeds 45Â°
- **Alcohol Detection**: Activates alerts if the alcohol level crosses a threshold
- **Helmet Detection**: Ensures the helmet is worn before operation
- **Theft Alert**: IR sensor triggers alert on unauthorized access
- **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic sensor detects objects within 20cm
- **SOS Alert**: Emergency messages are sent with a button press

## Challenges & Solutions

- **MQ3 Sensor Noise**: Mitigated by using a threshold of >300
- **False Crash Detection**: Limited to >45Â° tilt to reduce false alerts
- **Sensor Inconsistencies**: Delays and flags used to debounce inputs
- **Power Consumption**: Buzzer/LEDs turned on only when needed

## Expected Outcomes

- Real-time alerts for crashes, alcohol detection, and theft
- Efficient, low-power consumption design
- Scalable and practical for commercial and personal use
